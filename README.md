## Contributing

### Code Guide

We use GitHub Actions to make sure the codebase is consistent (`cargo +nightly fmt`) and continuously tested (`cargo test`). We try to keep comments at a maximum of 120 characters of length and code at 120.

## Building

BankID-rs uses [`maybe_async`](https://docs.rs/maybe-async/0.2.0/maybe_async/) to switch between async and blocking clients, which is triggered inside `Cargo.toml`. So that must be taken into account when building `bankid-rs`. Read the Configuration section in the docs for more information about how to build, and more.

```sh
$ cargo build
```

`bankid-rs` is also available as the `blocking` interface

```sh
$ cargo build --features sync
```
